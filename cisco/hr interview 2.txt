Why thousand eyes?
I liked that the process is very well organized, the people i've met and the engineering culture that you have, being full hands on.


How was the process?
Very well organized, very extensive but covers different skills. I wasn't happy with how programming 2 interview went and could've done better.


Questions:
What is next?
Does you recruit for all European offices?
Why have an interview in the office?
